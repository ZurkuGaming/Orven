Privacy Policy for Orven

Last Updated: February 28, 2025

Orven, created by zurku, connects you with others across Discord for private, 1-on-1 text chats. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your data.

1. What We Collect

To make Orven work, we temporarily collect:

User IDs: To identify you during matching and chats.
Guild IDs: To know which server you’re in (if applicable).
Channel IDs: To send match notifications (if in a server).
Messages: Only relayed between matched users, not stored or saved beyond active chats.
We don’t collect usernames, profile details, or anything else beyond what’s needed for matching.

2. Why We Use It

Match you with others via /search.
Manage chats and respect /anonymous settings.
Notify you of matches in DMs or channels.
We don’t use your data for anything else (e.g., no ads or analytics).

3. Storage and Security

Data is stored in a secure database only while you’re queued or chatting.
It’s deleted immediately when you use /leave, disconnect, or remove Orven from your server.

4. Sharing

We don’t share your data with third parties, except:
As required by law (e.g., legal requests).
Via Discord’s API, which processes IDs (see Discord’s Privacy Policy).
Messages are only sent to your matched partner, anonymously if you use /anonymous.

5. Your Rights

Stop data collection by not using Orven or removing it from your server.
No extra data is saved, so there’s nothing to request beyond active use.
Contact zurku or join discord.gg/rUpjWt49r8 for questions or help.

6. Age Restriction

Orven is for users 13+ only, per Discord’s rules.

7. Updates

We may update this policy. Check discord.gg/rUpjWt49r8 for the latest version.
